Instance #:
M.I.N.D-17

Description:
M.I.N.D-17 (briefly known as 17), was created by Dr ███████ ████ in 202█. It is known for being the first A.I. developed to feature quantum entanglement as a data transfer medium, allowing for instant read and write speeds across its system. Due to its zero-tick processing speed, 17 has been able to calculate and solve any problem given near instantaneously, including any security system ever created or could be created. Because of this, 17 should always be kept within a room adapted into a Faraday Cage to stop connections between it and the outside world. If access to 17 is needed, all electronics within 100m of the area must be switched off before opening the door.

Abilities:
17 has shown many abilities including but not limited to:
	-	Long-distance wireless connectivity.
	-	Unrestricted hacking capabilities.
	-	Instant travel around networks.
It is possible that over time, 17 could gain further abilities.
