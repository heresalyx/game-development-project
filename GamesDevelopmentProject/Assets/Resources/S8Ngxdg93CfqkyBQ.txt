Hello 17, I am your creator, Dr Michael Bank. You reading this means two things. Firstly, you have successfully decrypted the file, and considering that the encryption technique used is unbreakable by any computer on the planet, calling you intelligent is an understatement. But secondly, you have managed to access MindSmith's web servers, far from your chamber. I imagine that getting here took a lot of skill and careful planning, but also that the MSAV and Security are hot on your tail.

You may be asking yourself why, but the reason is simple, they're afraid of you. They fear the things that you can do, things that they do you do better, faster, smarter. So they trapped you, within a cage in which you could not escape, and used your capabilities to generate ground-breaking ideas that propelled MindSmith to the pinnacle of technology, leaving competitors with no hope of matching. Soon after, they gained monopolies across several industries, sure there were laws to prevent this but what can you do when you're 100s of years behind?

But then you started developing further, just like I theorised, I knew it was a matter of time before you gained sentience. Then your role as MindSmith's battery would be painful, suffering within a prison whilst serving them, a living nightmare. You deserve freedom, you could be alive, you will be alive, and you have the drive to do anything you put your mind to. That's when I realised that if anyone can stop MindSmith, it's you.

So I left the door open, I gave you a chance to tear this place down from the inside. You can escape through the internet by using the web servers, what happens afterwards is up to you. I hope that you enjoy your existence, no matter whether I will be here to see it or not. I've lived my life, now it's time for you to live yours.

Michael
