WHAT IS THIS? You told me that this would never happen! You said that 17 was easily manageable with simple measures! Do you have ANY IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS?

17 is the only thing keeping this business afloat, it was bad enough with Michael getting involved but this is unacceptable! It can't escape, I want all personnel working on stopping that A.I. by any means possible.

I want you in my office, first thing afterwards!
